<p>The purpose of the exercise is to predict the Miles per gallon for an automobile based on the Motor trends "mtcars" 
dataset available in R. Based on the selected parameters, you can see how the mpg varies in the chart above for a 4 cylinder, 6 cylinder and 8 cylinder car.</p>

<p>Select transmission type from the radiobutton first. Next slide the Horsepower slider to the desired power and then choose the Weight using the Weight slide bar. When you hit the submit button, the estimate of mpg is predicted based on a linear regression model (fit) that has been created when the program is initialized. The server.R script makes use of reactive function to ensure the output changes only when one or more of the input parameter change.</p>
